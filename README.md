## Icon may be necessary

An Icon may be necessary to include in the manifest.

Here is a dummy icon until we get a real one. (I'm not really artistically creative/inclined).

## Create a Developer account

I'm assuming this was done and set up correctly by someone on the higher ups end?

## Upload your app

Uploading seems pretty straightforward, assuming we have a Developer Account

## Payment

I'm assuming we're omitting payment for the app.

## Provide Store Content

### NEEDED: 
A detailed description of your application. Write your description to entice users to download your app.
A 128x128 icon to display in the store. You may re-use your app icon here.
At least one 1280x800 or 640x400 screenshot or YouTube video to show off what your app does.
A 440x280 small tile icon that will be displayed on the Chrome Web Store wall.
The primary category where your app should be listed.
Your app's language to help users find it.
