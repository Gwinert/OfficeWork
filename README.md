# Uploading to Chrome Store
These are the instructions for uploading an application to the developer chrome store.

## Step 01) Create your app’s zip file

To upload your app, you need to create a ZIP file that contains at least one file: your app's manifest.

Manifest files are .json files that contain important information about your app. They contain the following:

App name - Displayed in the Chrome Web Store and in the Chrome launcher
Version - The version of the metadata, incremented
It should also contain a few images and any other files that the app requires. The contents of the ZIP file and manifest depend on the type of app you're writing and its capabilities. For details, see the documentation for the type of app you're writing:
