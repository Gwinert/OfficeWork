#Let's get learning

###Step 01.) NPM (Node Package Manager) Introduction

[Watch Videos 01-02 at docs.npmjs.com/getting-started](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started).
Also, make sure node and npm are properly installed. A good check is to open the command line and run 'node -v' and make sure 
the most up to date version number is displayed. [Compare verisons against node.js.org](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Step 02.) Getting Started with Learnyounode

Get started by running the following in cmd
"npm install -g learnyounode"
And then
"learnyounode"
Start off by attempting the first 5 Excercises (Hello World - Filtered LS)

If you need help with an excercise don't be afraid to ask another team member or post about it [here](https://github.com/nodeschool/discussions/issues).

###Step 03.) NPM Continued!

Go ahead and watch NPM Videos [04 - Installing npm packages locally](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally), [05 - Using a `package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json), and [11 - Creating Node.js modules](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/creating-node-modules).

###Step 04.) Learnyounode Continued.

Return to the command line and run
learnyounode
Carry on from excercise 06, and work your way through excercise 8.

Once again, if you get stuck or need help, feel free to ask around, or post it [here](https://github.com/nodeschool/discussions/issues).
Specifically, a good resource for Excercise 6 can be found [here](https://github.com/nodeschool/discussions/issues/1028)

###Step 05.) Callbacks!!!

Read [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/Using_js-ctypes/Declaring_and_Using_Callbacks) on callbacks.

and then complete Learnyounode excercises 9-13. 

After completing the excercises, please finish watching the remaining NPM videos located [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started).
